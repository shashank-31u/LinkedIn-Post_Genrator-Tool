      "text": "Foundations of LLMs is an awesome new book just released!\nThe content covers the foundational concepts of large language models. Here's an overview of the chapters:\n\n1️⃣Pre-training: The core idea of pre-training NLP models, the history and techniques (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised learning), and detailed methods such as masked and permuted language modeling.\n2️⃣Generative Models: Explores how large language models are constructed, scaled, and fine-tuned for generating human-like text.\n3️⃣Prompting Methods: Covers various strategies to guide language models to perform specific tasks using prompts, including advanced techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning.\n4️⃣Alignment: Focuses on methods to align large language models with human values and tasks through instruction fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\n\nI just had a chance to briefly check it out, very comprehensive! This is a perfect guide for understanding the mechanisms that make LLMs powerful, with insights into training strategies, applications, and future potential.\n\nIf you are a leader looking for more practical guidance, check this executive Course by top AI educators/practitioners. https://bit.ly/4gdSEn4\n\nBy Tong Xiao and Jingbo Zhu\ndownload the full pdf here: https://lnkd.in/gtbBrd4v",

      "text": "📢Today, ChatGPT’s Agentic Era Begins with a Leap\n\nAI assistant doesn’t just respond—it proactively manages parts of your life. With the release of Tasks, OpenAI has just taken a significant step toward making this vision a reality.\n\nHere’s the story:\nThe new Tasks feature enables ChatGPT to schedule and execute actions for you, from one-time reminders to recurring routines. Whether it’s a daily list of the latest AI news, creating personalized workouts, or even a gentle nudge to learn a new word in your favorite language, Tasks is here to take productivity to the next level.\n\nWhy this is groundbreaking:\n✔Proactive AI: Tasks are a step beyond reactive interactions. ChatGPT can now anticipate your needs, acting more like an intelligent agent than a simple assistant.\n✔Personalized Automation: By suggesting recurring tasks based on your chat history, it’s learning how to be your go-to personal assistant.\n✔Efficiency Redefined: With up to 10 active tasks at once, you can offload repetitive tasks, freeing yourself for higher-value activities.\n\nSome Future Use Cases:\n1️⃣ Personalized Education: Daily language lessons or coding puzzles delivered seamlessly.\n2️⃣ Health Management: Reminders for medication, fitness plans, or mindfulness routines.\n3️⃣ Business Productivity: Scheduling team updates, generating daily reports, or even monitoring critical data trends.\n\nTasks are just the beginning. In future autonomous AI Agents will handle workflows, integrates deeply into tools, and becomes a trusted partner in personal and professional growth.\n\nI see this as a pivotal moment. We’re witnessing the evolution of AI from assistant to agent, from follower to proactive partner.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n📢We have spent last 2 months with a group of Generative AI thought leaders, top professors and C-Levels to make the ultimate AI for Executive course. The team is the Avengers of the AI world. here is the link for early birds: https://lnkd.in/gv-9r4xN",

      "text": "I am fascinated with the AI Agent products released recently, this will be one of the major topics in 2025 and you should not miss it out:\n\n---Lets start with basics:\n1️⃣Agent Core: The central processing unit that integrates all functionalities, acting as the 'brain' of the agent.\n2️⃣Memory Module: Stores and retrieves information to maintain context and continuity over time, allowing the agent to learn from past interactions and adapt to new situations.\n3️⃣Perception Module: Collects and interprets data from the environment, enabling the agent to understand and respond to external inputs.\n4️⃣Planning Module: Analyzes problems and devises strategies to solve them, enabling the agent to set goals and determine the best course of action.\n5️⃣Action Module: Executes the planned actions, allowing the agent to interact with its environment and achieve its objectives.\n6️⃣Tools Integration: External resources and APIs the agent can use to perform specific tasks, extending its capabilities beyond its inherent functions.\n\n---Capabilities:\n1️⃣ Advanced Problem Solving: AI agents can plan and execute complex tasks, such as generating project plans, writing code, running benchmarks, and creating summaries.\n2️⃣ Self-Reflection and Improvement: AI agents can analyze their own output, identify problems, and provide constructive feedback. By incorporating this feedback and repeating the criticism/rewrite process, agents can continually improve their performance across various tasks.\n3️⃣ Tool Utilization: AI agents can use tools to evaluate their output, such as running unit tests on code to check for correctness or searching the web to verify text accuracy. This allows them to reflect on errors and propose improvements.\n4️⃣ Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: Implementing a multi-agent framework, where one agent generates outputs, and another provides constructive criticism, leads to enhanced performance through iterative feedback and discussion.\n\n----Reasoning Frameworks:\n1️⃣Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Encourages the agent to decompose complex problems into a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps, enhancing problem-solving capabilities.\n2️⃣ReAct (Reasoning and Acting): Integrates reasoning and acting by allowing the agent to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, enabling dynamic decision-making.\n3️⃣Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT): Generalizes the CoT approach by enabling exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem-solving, allowing for strategic lookahead and backtracking.\n\n📢I have spent last 2 months with a group of AI thought leaders, top professors and C levels to make the ultimate AI for Executive course. The team is the Avengers of the AI world. If you are interested to join as beta tester just comment \"AI Agents\"🔥\n\n📢Update: We picked 20 Beta testers, here is the link for early bird price only valid for 72 hours: https://bit.ly/4gdSEn4",

And OpenAI just released these timelines and more screenshots of the conversations:\n▪ November 2015: OpenAI started as a nonprofit, which Elon questioned\n▪ December 2015: OpenAI publicly announced\n▪ Early 2017: Our research progress led us to realize we would need billions of dollars for the compute to build AGI\n▪ Summer 2017: We and Elon agreed that a for-profit was the next step for OpenAI to advance the mission\n▪ Fall 2017: Elon demanded majority equity, absolute control, and to be CEO of the for-profit\n▪ September 2017: Elon created the public benefit corporation called “Open Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc.”\n▪ September 2017: We rejected Elon's terms because giving him unilateral control of OpenAI and its technology would be contrary to the mission\n▪ January 2018: Elon said OpenAI was on a path for certain failure unless we merged into Tesla.\n▪ February 2018: Elon resigned as co-chair of OpenAI\n▪ December 2018: Elon told us to raise “billions per year immediately or forget it”\n▪ March 2019: We announced the capped-profit OpenAI LP, within the non-profit\n▪ March 2023: Elon started his OpenAI competitor, xAI\n\nRegardless of all these dramas, 12 days of OpenAI is bringing attention back to their new services.\n\nAlthough it seems that ChatGPT's performance almost plateaued, their other services adding better UI/UX changes the whole dynamics.\n\nEven after SORA I am not convinced with the hefty $200 per month price tag but cant deny Chatgpt plus is still a great value for the money.",
